    <h2 class="rela-block caps title">Who are we looking for? 🔎
At Hawaiian, we don’t grow (only) by starting more projects, but by finishing the right projects. And that’s often where scale-ups struggle: good ideas, strong teams, but too little structure, prioritization, and ownership. That’s why we’re looking for a PMO Manager. Not as a note-taker. Not as a PowerPoint polisher. But as someone who brings order to complexity and pushes projects through the organization until they deliver results.
You recognize yourself in several of these points:
You have at least 8 years of experience in project or program management, preferably in a scale-up, retail, food, or operations-heavy environment.
You think in a structured way, but act pragmatically.
You dare to challenge people — including senior stakeholders — without political hassle.
You understand how projects impact operations, people, and numbers.
You feel comfortable in complexity and can translate it into clear choices.
You communicate clearly, concisely, and to the point.
You value ownership: “that’s not my project” is not in your vocabulary.
Experience with PMO tools, portfolio management, or change frameworks is required.
You can identify with our Hawaiian Values.
What will you be doing? 🚀
Your role
As a PMO Manager, you are the backbone of our project organization. You ensure that strategic and operational projects don’t get stuck in good intentions, but are effectively implemented in our restaurants, support office, and central kitchen.
You work closely with ExCo, Operations, People, Digital, Finance, and Excellence. You report directly to the CEO — further underlining the importance of this role.
Concretely:
You oversee the end-to-end project portfolio: priorities, timelines, dependencies, and impact.
You establish a clear PMO structure: governance, templates, decision-making, and reporting.
You challenge project owners on scope, planning, resources, and feasibility.
You identify risks early and course-correct before they hit the P&L or operations.
You make projects measurable: milestones, KPIs, and impact on costs, quality, and efficiency.
You ensure clear communication toward stakeholders and ExCo.
You help teams work better by creating focus, not through micromanagement.
This is a hands-on role: you are in the projects, not above them.
What this role is not
One of our values is “Be Real,” so we won’t sugarcoat it:
This is not a purely administrative PMO role.
This is not a role where you only create status updates.
This is not a role without decision-making power.
You are given freedom, but also responsibility. When projects go off track, we expect you to see it, call it out, and (help) resolve it.
What do we offer? 🫶🏻
A key role in an organization that is rapidly professionalizing.
Direct impact on how Hawaiian works, grows, and performs.
Close collaboration with ExCo and senior stakeholders.
A culture of ownership, honesty, and continuous improvement.
Compensation, of course! We offer a market-competitive compensation package, aligned with experience and impact:
Gross salary up to €6,250 (depending on experience)
Net expense allowance
Company car (Tesla Model Y or Mercedes)
Meal vouchers of €10/day
DKV hospitalization insurance
Trust and a great working atmosphere: you will be part of the Digital team and work within a flexible schedule where the focus is primarily on output. We don’t micromanage (pinky promise).</h2>

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the PMO Manager role at Hawaiian. My background combines program and project leadership in digital/cloud transformations with hands-on hospitality operations—experience that directly maps to your need for someone who brings structure, ownership and measurable delivery to operationally‑heavy projects.

As a Program/Project Manager at a cloud solution provider I led end-to-end transformation programs (including a strategic €1M–€1.8M program), orchestrating cross-functional teams of 2–25 FTEs under hybrid delivery models. I strengthened governance and reporting standards across business units, introduced measurable milestones and KPIs, and used Microsoft Project, Jira and Excel to maintain portfolio visibility and timely decision-making.

In parallel, as a General Manager in multi-site hospitality I owned P&L and day-to-day operations (€1.8M–€2.5M annual revenue), launched Itsu’s first European store and drove rapid financial recovery after COVID. That operational ownership gives me practical insight into how projects impact costs, quality, staffing and customer experience—so I challenge scope and feasibility early to avoid downstream disruption.

I have embedded change frameworks (ADKAR and Kotter) in organization-wide initiatives to improve adoption and course-correct before projects hit the P&L. I work closely with senior stakeholders, make governance practical rather than bureaucratic, and remain hands-on in delivery rather than producing only status updates.

I am motivated by Hawaiian’s emphasis on ownership and finishing the right projects. I can quickly establish PMO structures (governance, templates, reporting), enforce clear prioritization across the portfolio, and enable teams to focus and deliver measurable impact without micromanagement.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can help Hawaiian translate strategy into executed results across restaurants, support office and central kitchen.

Sincerely,
<your name>
    </p>
