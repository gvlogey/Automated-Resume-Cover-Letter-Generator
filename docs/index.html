    <h2 class="rela-block caps title">Who are we looking for? 🔎
At Hawaiian, we don’t grow (only) by starting more projects, but by finishing the right projects. And that’s often where scale-ups struggle: good ideas, strong teams, but too little structure, prioritization, and ownership. That’s why we’re looking for a PMO Manager. Not as a note-taker. Not as a PowerPoint polisher. But as someone who brings order to complexity and pushes projects through the organization until they deliver results.
You recognize yourself in several of these points:
You have at least 8 years of experience in project or program management, preferably in a scale-up, retail, food, or operations-heavy environment.
You think in a structured way, but act pragmatically.
You dare to challenge people — including senior stakeholders — without political hassle.
You understand how projects impact operations, people, and numbers.
You feel comfortable in complexity and can translate it into clear choices.
You communicate clearly, concisely, and to the point.
You value ownership: “that’s not my project” is not in your vocabulary.
Experience with PMO tools, portfolio management, or change frameworks is required.
You can identify with our Hawaiian Values.
What will you be doing? 🚀
Your role
As a PMO Manager, you are the backbone of our project organization. You ensure that strategic and operational projects don’t get stuck in good intentions, but are effectively implemented in our restaurants, support office, and central kitchen.
You work closely with ExCo, Operations, People, Digital, Finance, and Excellence. You report directly to the CEO — further underlining the importance of this role.
Concretely:
You oversee the end-to-end project portfolio: priorities, timelines, dependencies, and impact.
You establish a clear PMO structure: governance, templates, decision-making, and reporting.
You challenge project owners on scope, planning, resources, and feasibility.
You identify risks early and course-correct before they hit the P&L or operations.
You make projects measurable: milestones, KPIs, and impact on costs, quality, and efficiency.
You ensure clear communication toward stakeholders and ExCo.
You help teams work better by creating focus, not through micromanagement.
This is a hands-on role: you are in the projects, not above them.
What this role is not
One of our values is “Be Real,” so we won’t sugarcoat it:
This is not a purely administrative PMO role.
This is not a role where you only create status updates.
This is not a role without decision-making power.
You are given freedom, but also responsibility. When projects go off track, we expect you to see it, call it out, and (help) resolve it.
What do we offer? 🫶🏻
A key role in an organization that is rapidly professionalizing.
Direct impact on how Hawaiian works, grows, and performs.
Close collaboration with ExCo and senior stakeholders.
A culture of ownership, honesty, and continuous improvement.
Compensation, of course! We offer a market-competitive compensation package, aligned with experience and impact:
Gross salary up to €6,250 (depending on experience)
Net expense allowance
Company car (Tesla Model Y or Mercedes)
Meal vouchers of €10/day
DKV hospitalization insurance
Trust and a great working atmosphere: you will be part of the Digital team and work within a flexible schedule where the focus is primarily on output. We don’t micromanage (pinky promise).</h2>

Dear Hiring Team,

I am applying for the PMO Manager role at Hawaiian. I bring over eight years of project and program leadership across cloud/SaaS delivery and multi-site hospitality operations, and I focus on establishing pragmatic governance and delivery discipline so initiatives are completed and deliver measurable impact.

From my experience table: I led client and internal delivery programs ranging €20K–€200K and a strategic transformation program of €1M–€1.8M; managed end-to-end SaaS implementations (€10K–€70K); and orchestrated cross-functional teams of 2–25 FTEs under hybrid Agile/Waterfall models. I strengthened governance and reporting standards across business units, introduced decision gates and templates, and embedded ADKAR and Kotter change approaches into organization-wide initiatives to secure adoption.

On the operations side I ran multi-site hospitality operations generating €1.8M–€2.5M annually, launched Itsu’s first European store, and achieved operational profitability within three months post-COVID—experience that gives me direct P&L ownership and a clear view of how projects impact people, costs and service delivery.

I use Jira, Microsoft Project, Confluence, Excel and Power Automate to keep portfolios visible, map dependencies and surface risks before they reach the P&L. I routinely challenge project owners and senior stakeholders on scope, planning and resourcing, and I remove blockers through pragmatic, hands-on intervention rather than micromanagement. I make projects measurable with clear milestones, KPIs and ExCo-level reporting.

I am motivated by Hawaiian’s focus on finishing the right projects. I will establish a clear PMO structure—governance, templates, decision gates and reporting—align the portfolio to ExCo priorities, and ensure implementations deliver tangible cost, quality and efficiency improvements across restaurants, the support office and the central kitchen.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my blend of governance, change-management and operational delivery experience can help Hawaiian finish the right projects.

Sincerely,
<your name>
    </p>
